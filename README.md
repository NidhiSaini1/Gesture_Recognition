## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Recorded gestures using the [Phyphox app](https://phyphox.org).
   - Diverse scenarios for robust dataset creation (sitting, walking, standing).

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Applied Butterworth low-pass filtering to reduce noise.
   - Used sliding window segmentation for meaningful data chunks.
   - Normalized and standardized data.

3. **Feature Extraction**:
   - Time-domain and frequency-domain features.
   - Wavelet-based feature decomposition for temporal insights.

4. **Model Training**:
   - Trained models with hyperparameter tuning.
   - Balanced dataset using SMOTE.

5. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Gradient Boosting Classifier achieved the highest accuracy.
   - Random Forest and SVC performed competitively.
